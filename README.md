## 🛠️ Featured Project: MCQ Generator for Anki 🗂️
**An automated pipeline that transforms source material into high-quality active recall flashcards.**

This project solves the "bottleneck" of manual study preparation by using LLMs to analyze codebases or text and generate formatted CSVs ready for Anki import.

* **Core Tech:** Python, LangChain, Repomix, Anki Connect.
* **Key Feature:** Context-aware generation—the AI understands the relationship between files to create deep-logic questions, not just simple definitions.
* **Outcome:** Reduced study-prep time by 80% for technical subjects.
